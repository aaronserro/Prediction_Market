#Welcome to the Fantasy Prediction Market

A decentralized-style **fantasy prediction market** where users use **virtual currency** to create, trade, and participate in prediction events — from sports and entertainment to technology and global affairs — all without real money.  

This project merges a **Spring Boot backend** and a **React (Vite)** frontend into one full-stack system designed for scalability, transparency, and gamified user interaction.

##Overview

The **Fantasy Prediction Market** lets users:
- 🪙 Create and trade event contracts using **virtual currency**.
- 📈 Participate in **real-world prediction events** with zero legal or financial risk.
- 💬 Compete, analyze, and discuss outcomes across categories (sports, politics, pop culture, etc.).
- 🧩 Earn **reputation scores and badges** through accurate predictions.
- 🧾 Track all balances and transactions via an auditable wallet system.

It combines the mechanics of **Polymarket** and **Fantasy Sports**, but operates entirely on **virtual points**, enabling wide accessibility and monetization through **ads, sponsorships, and freemium features**.
